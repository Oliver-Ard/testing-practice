# Test Driven Development (TDD)

[Test Driven Development (TDD)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#:~:text=Test%2Ddriven%20development%20(TDD),software%20against%20all%20test%20cases.>) practice with [`Jest`](https://jestjs.io/) framework.

I've created 5 functions and tests for every function:

- `capitalize`: takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized;
- `reverseString`: takes a string and returns it reversed;
- `calculator`: object that contains functions for the basic operations(`add`, `subtract`, `divide` and `multiply`);
- `caesarCipher`: takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”. **[Here](https://crypto.interactive-maths.com/caesar-shift-cipher.html)** you can learn more about Caesar Cipher;
- `analyzeArray`: takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties(`average`, `min`, `max` and `length`);
